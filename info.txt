1. The about section has a box inside a box. The Rammed Earth chronicle box has "About" box. These can be two sections separated by a line or something.
2. The buttons: Read the full story, Read the chronicles, are lenghtier than "work with me" button. I like them of same width. You can consider shortening the caption if needed. All buttons in different tabs should follow this. Builder directory tab, community Q & A tab etc. What happens with the mobile device that places buttons in vertical order, they look odd
What about moving the quiz to a separate page? In that way the home page can be decluttered
When I hit the button "work with me" it takes me to quiz-index.html. There remove the first box which talks about me once again. The "take consutation quiz" and other buttons take me back to the index page whre the quiz is available. Instead it can lead to the dedicated quiz page, where instructions etc would be giving. If you think the tab for each quiz would be cumborsome, you can consider having dedicated pagges. This could make the navigation interesting and clear.
I guess we have two landing pages for quiz. As it is confined to my work, we can consider the 7 landing pages we designed, with algoritham, meta talk about it, assurance that I would read them, tell them that if the algorithm does not did it work right in their case, or they have a comment encourage them to send email 
construct a flow. how it works ? options, 1 work with me , visit directory, submit a form to find one.
should we move the about tab as the last one as we had it earlier? Or it still make sense to keep it as the first tab? Keep it as the first tab if that makes the branding solid.
