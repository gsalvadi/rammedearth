        <h2>Template 1: Requesting Answer from Professional (First Time)</h2>
        <p><strong>When to use:</strong> First time asking a specific professional to answer a question</p>

        <div class="template">
            <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Question for Community Q&A - <span class="variable">[TOPIC]</span></p>

            <p>Hi <span class="variable">[PROFESSIONAL_NAME]</span>,</p>

            <p>I received a question through the Rammed Earth Chronicles Community Q&A that matches your expertise, and I thought you might be interested in answering it.</p>

            <p><strong>The Question:</strong><br>
            "<span class="variable">[QUESTION_TEXT]</span>"</p>

            <p><strong>Context from asker (if provided):</strong><br>
            <span class="variable">[OPTIONAL: Any context the asker provided about their situation, location, or constraints]</span></p>

            <p>The Community Q&A is a curated archive where professionals like you answer questions about earthen building. When you answer, your response gets published with attribution linking back to your directory listing—free visibility and a way to demonstrate your expertise.</p>

            <p>If you're interested, I've put together a short guide about contributing answers:<br>
            <span class="variable">[YOUR_SITE_URL]</span>/qa-professional-guide.html</p>

            <p><strong>No pressure</strong>—if you don't have time or this isn't your specialty, no worries at all. Just let me know.</p>

            <p>If you'd like to answer, simply reply to this email with your response (2-4 paragraphs works well). I'll handle formatting and publishing.</p>

            <p>Thanks for considering it!<br>

        </div>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>Note:</strong> First-time requests include the guide link to explain the process. Subsequent requests to the same professional can use the shorter template below.

        <h2>Template 2: Requesting Answer from Professional (Returning)</h2>

            <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Q&A Question - <span class="variable">[TOPIC]</span></p>

            <p>Hi <span class="variable">[PROFESSIONAL_NAME]</span>,</p>

            <p>Got another question that's right in your wheelhouse:</p>

            <p>"<span class="variable">[QUESTION_TEXT]</span>"</p>

            <p><strong>Context:</strong><br>
            <span class="variable">[OPTIONAL: Asker's location, project details, or constraints if provided]</span></p>

            <p>Interested in answering? Just reply with your thoughts (2-4 paragraphs). I'll publish it on the Q&A page with attribution to your directory listing.</p>

            <p>If you're too busy or it's outside your expertise, no worries—let me know and I'll find someone else.</p>

        <h2>Template 3: Requesting Second Opinion / Multiple Answers</h2>
        <p><strong>When to use:</strong> You already have one answer but want a different perspective</p>

        <div class="template">
            <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Second opinion needed - <span class="variable">[TOPIC]</span></p>

            <p>Hi <span class="variable">[PROFESSIONAL_NAME]</span>,</p>

            <p>I have a question that's already been answered by <span class="variable">[FIRST_ANSWERER_NAME]</span>, but I think a second perspective would be valuable since the topic has nuance.</p>

            <p><strong>The Question:</strong><br>
            "<span class="variable">[QUESTION_TEXT]</span>"</p>

            <p><strong>First answer summary:</strong><br>
            <span class="variable">[BRIEF 1-2 SENTENCE SUMMARY OF FIRST ANSWER]</span></p>

            <p>I think your experience with <span class="variable">[THEIR_SPECIALTY_OR_REGION]</span> would add a different angle. Interested in contributing your perspective?</p>

            <p>Just reply with your thoughts (2-4 paragraphs). Multiple answers help questioners understand there's no single "right" way.</p>

            <p>Thanks!<br>
