        <h1>You're Finding Your Way</h1>
        <div class="subtitle">You have genuine interest and the right instincts</div>

        <div class="intro">
            I can see from your responses that you have real curiosity about earth building. You're starting to understand that this isn't just about technique—there's something deeper here. What you need now is more direct experience with the material to deepen that understanding.
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Where You Are</h2>
            <p>You're in what I call the "awakening" phase. You've moved past thinking earth building is just an interesting idea, but you haven't yet developed the embodied knowledge that comes from sustained hands-on work.</p>

            <p>This is actually a crucial stage. Many people rush past it, trying to jump straight to building projects. But the foundation you build now—through patient, focused practice—will determine everything that comes after.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            "The material will teach you, but only if you give it time and attention. These practices aren't preparation for the real work—they ARE the real work."
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Your Next Steps</h2>
            <p>Here are four practices that will move you from interested to truly capable. Do them in order, and don't rush.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="practice-box">
            <h3>Four Essential Practices</h3>

            <div class="practice-item">
                <h4>1. Build Something Small That Must Survive One Full Season</h4>
                <p><strong>What:</strong> A garden wall, a bench, a small structure—something that will face real weather for an entire year.</p>
                <p><strong>Why:</strong> You'll learn what works and what fails. More importantly, you'll learn to read the signs before failure happens.</p>
                <p><strong>How:</strong> Start with something 3-4 feet tall maximum. Use local soil. Document it monthly with photos and notes. Watch what changes.</p>
                <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 12 full months from completion</p>
            </div>

            <div class="practice-item">
                <h4>2. Work With Earth for 30 Days Without Tutorials</h4>
                <p><strong>What:</strong> Daily practice with earth—mixing, testing, forming—without following anyone else's instructions.</p>
                <p><strong>Why:</strong> Tutorials teach you techniques. Direct experience teaches you principles. You need the principles.</p>
                <p><strong>How:</strong> 30-60 minutes per day. Different soil ratios, different moisture levels, different compaction. Just observe and document what happens.</p>
                <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 30 consecutive days</p>
            </div>

            <div class="practice-item">
                <h4>3. Document What Goes Wrong, Not What Goes Right</h4>
                <p><strong>What:</strong> Keep a failure journal. Every crack, collapse, weak spot, surprise—write it down with brutal honesty.</p>
                <p><strong>Why:</strong> Failure is information. Most people hide from it or make excuses. You need to mine it for what it reveals.</p>
                <p><strong>How:</strong> Photograph every failure. Write what you think caused it. A month later, write what you NOW think caused it. Notice the difference.</p>
                <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Ongoing practice</p>
            </div>

            <div class="practice-item">
                <h4>4. Find Local Earth Builders and Observe Their Process</h4>
                <p><strong>What:</strong> Spend time watching experienced builders work. Don't just see the techniques—see their rhythm, their decision-making, their relationship with mistakes.</p>
                <p><strong>Why:</strong> Books and videos can't teach you the embodied knowledge that comes from watching a skilled person work.</p>
                <p><strong>How:</strong> Check the <a href="directory.html" style="color: #8B4513;">directory</a>. Reach out respectfully. Offer to help in exchange for observation. Ask questions that start with "how do you know when..."</p>
                <p><strong>Duration:</strong> At least 2-3 full work days</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What You'll Learn</h2>
            <p>If you do these practices seriously, here's what will shift:</p>

            <div class="resource-box">
                <ul>
                    <li>You'll develop an intuitive sense for soil consistency and moisture content</li>
                    <li>You'll understand compression and structural stability at a felt level</li>
                    <li>You'll recognize the difference between your plan failing and the material teaching</li>
                    <li>You'll build realistic timelines based on actual experience, not optimism</li>
                    <li>You'll know which questions to ask because you've encountered real problems</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Resources to Support Your Practice</h2>

            <div class="resource-box">
                <h4>Essential Reading</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>"The Rammed Earth House" by David Easton</li>
                    <li>"Building with Earth: A Guide to Flexible-Form Earthbag Construction" by Paulina Wojciechowska</li>
                    <li>"The Hand-Sculpted House" by Ianto Evans (for understanding material relationships)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="resource-box">
                <h4>Online Resources</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://rammedearth.substack.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #8B4513;">The Rammed Earth Chronicles</a> - Essays on the deeper practice</li>
                    <li>The Rammed Earth Alliance - Technical resources and community</li>
                    <li>Your local soil conservation district - Free soil testing and advice</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>When You're Ready for Consultation</h2>
            <p>After you've worked through these practices—and I mean really worked through them, not just skimmed—reach out again. At that point, you'll have:</p>

            <ul style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: 15px;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Specific questions based on your actual experience</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">A sense of your local soil's behavior and possibilities</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Some failures to learn from together</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Realistic understanding of your own capacity and commitment</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">At that point, consultation becomes truly valuable—because you'll know what questions to ask and how to use the guidance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            "Don't rush this stage. The people who do these practices patiently end up building better, faster, and with more confidence than those who skip straight to their project. Take the time now to build your foundation."
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>One More Thing</h2>
            <p>Keep notes. Not just of what happens, but of how you feel about it. Your frustrations, your small victories, your changing relationship with the material. This record will become invaluable later—both for your own learning and for when we talk.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">You're welcome to reach out with questions as you work through these practices. I may not always have time for detailed responses, but I read everything.</p>
