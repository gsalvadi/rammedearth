        <div class="subtitle">A guide for professionals in the directory</div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>Thank you for considering contributing your expertise!</h3>
            <p>The Community Q&A helps people who are exploring earthen building but aren't yet ready to hire someone. When you answer questions, you:</p>
            <ul class="benefit-list">
                <li>Demonstrate your expertise to potential clients</li>
                <li>Get SEO visibility (your answer links to your directory listing)</li>
                <li>Help grow the earthen building community</li>
                <li>Position yourself as a knowledgeable professional</li>
                <li>Create shareable content that showcases your approach</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>I receive questions via the site's Q&A form</li>
            <li>I review and select quality questions</li>
            <li>When a question matches your expertise/location, I'll email it to you</li>
            <li>You reply with your answer (no special format required)</li>
            <li>I publish it on the Q&A page with attribution linking to your directory listing</li>
            <li>If the asker provided their email, I notify them of the answer</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>No pressure:</strong> If you receive a question but don't have time or it's outside your expertise, just let me know. There's no obligation to answer every question.
        </div>

        <h2>What Makes a Good Answer?</h2>

        <h3>1. Practical and Specific</h3>
        <p>People ask questions because they're facing real decisions. Give them actionable information.</p>

        <div class="example good-example">
            <strong>✓ Good:</strong> "For small residential projects under 2000 sq ft, I recommend a mid-range pneumatic tamper in the 60-90 lb range. The Wacker Neuson BS60-2i works well. Make sure your air compressor can deliver minimum 15 CFM at 90 PSI. For most owner-builders, renting makes more sense than buying."
        </div>

        <div class="example poor-example">
            <strong>✗ Less helpful:</strong> "You need a good tamper and proper equipment. It depends on your project."
        </div>

        <h3>2. Share Your Experience</h3>
        <p>What have you learned from actually doing this work? Your real-world experience is more valuable than textbook knowledge.</p>

        <div class="example good-example">
            <strong>✓ Good:</strong> "I've built cob structures in Kerala (very humid) that have performed well for 15+ years. The key is generous roof overhangs—minimum 1 meter—and allowing 6-12 months drying time before plastering."
        </div>

        <h3>3. Acknowledge Nuance</h3>
        <p>There's rarely one "right" answer in earthen building. Sharing trade-offs helps people make informed decisions.</p>

        <div class="example good-example">
            <strong>✓ Good:</strong> "I prefer stabilizing with small amounts of lime (5-8%) for tropical climates. Not traditional, but improves moisture resistance. The trade-off: slightly less thermal mass, but better long-term durability in high humidity."
        </div>

        <h3>4. Be Honest About Limits</h3>
        <p>If something is outside your experience or requires site-specific assessment, say so.</p>

        <div class="example good-example">
            <strong>✓ Good:</strong> "This really depends on your local soil composition and building codes. I'd need to see soil test results and know your jurisdiction to give specific guidance. In general, though..."
        </div>

        <h2>Answer Length</h2>
        <p><strong>Aim for 100-300 words per answer.</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Too short (1-2 sentences): Doesn't provide enough value</li>
            <li>Just right (2-4 paragraphs): Practical, thorough, readable</li>
            <li>Too long (essay): People won't read it all</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Structure that works well:</strong>
            <ul style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0;">
                <li>Paragraph 1: Direct answer to the question</li>
                <li>Paragraph 2: Context, caveats, or additional considerations</li>
                <li>Paragraph 3: Alternative approaches or next steps (if relevant)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Topics You Might Be Asked About</h2>
        <p>Questions span all earthen building techniques:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rammed earth construction</li>

        <div class="tip-box">
            I'll match questions to your specific expertise and location when possible. You won't receive questions far outside your area of knowledge.
        </div>

        <h2>Multiple Perspectives Welcome</h2>
        <p>Sometimes multiple professionals answer the same question. This is valuable! Different approaches show there's no single "right" way, and it helps questioners understand trade-offs.</p>

        <p>If you see a question already answered by someone else, you can still contribute if you have a different perspective or additional context.</p>

        <h2>Attribution & Visibility</h2>
        <p>Your answer will be published with attribution like this:</p>

        <div class="example">
            <em>"— Answered by <strong>[Your Name]</strong>, [Your Title], [Your Location]"</em>
        </div>

        <p>Your name will link to your directory listing, giving readers a direct path to learn more about your work and contact you.</p>

        <h2>Time Commitment</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You might receive 1-3 questions per month (varies by specialty)</li>
            <li>Each answer takes 10-20 minutes to write</li>
            <li>Completely voluntary—decline any time</li>
            <li>No minimum commitment</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>Nothing to do now except wait! When I have a question that matches your expertise, I'll email it to you with context about the asker (if they provided it).</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Simply reply to that email with your answer in plain text. I'll handle formatting and publishing.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box" style="margin-top: 30px;">
