I've been thinking about how we build buildings that last. Not just structurally—though that matters—but buildings that remain relevant. A rammed earth wall from centuries ago still teaches us something about compression and layering. Yet most modern construction feels designed for replacement, not endurance.

This week I read about Japanese temple builders who plan for 200-year maintenance cycles. They don't just build; they create systems for future craftspeople to continue the work. The building becomes a practice, not just a product. It reminded me of how every soil test I run is teaching the next person who works with that site's earth.

There's a pattern here about knowledge transfer that goes beyond documentation. When you build with earth, you're forced to understand the material in ways that manufactured products let you skip. The learning is embedded in the doing. You can't rush rammed earth—the moisture has to be right, the compaction consistent, the patience genuine.

Maybe that's what makes earthen buildings last: not just the material properties, but the fact that building with earth requires you to slow down enough to actually learn. And that learning becomes part of the structure itself, waiting for the next person who cares enough to look.
