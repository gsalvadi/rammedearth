        <h1>The Story</h1>
        <div class="subtitle">How I learned rammed earth, and why teaching matters more than building</div>
         <p> You might know me from music or writing, but here we're talking about rammed earth.</p>

        <p> I learned it to build my own house—and I did. With no background in soil mechanics or structural engineering, I taught myself through testing, mentorship, and plenty of pauses. Now I build, write, and connect people serious about earthen construction.</p>
      

        <p>
            My journey was not a complex as my credentials had nothing to do with either soil mechanics or structural principles of buildings. The construction was not steady. I paused it often to learn or test something. That experience includes everything from understanding earth to understanding social perceptions of earthen buildings.
        </p>

        <p>
          I wanted to tell my story and created the Substack publication named The Rammed Earth Chronicles. Writing was not my craft either. When I wrote how I do something, it became a dry how-to manual. When I wrote about my intentions and how it felt while facing an obstacle, it came out as a story with no educational value. I knew there was a missing piece but could not figure out what it was. At one point, I slowed down and almost stopped writing on Substack.
        </p>

        <p>
            A few years later, when I had a chance to write my debut on a different subject (that has nothing to do with earthen buildings), I had to learn "how to write." One can see the progression from the earliest blogs to recent ones on Substack.

        <p>
            During my journey, I almost set up a mini lab in my home to test soil properties. I would never forgive the ruthelss Casagrande Apparatus. It reminded me of when I struggled to figure out "Heuristic Algorithms" during my University course.        </p>

        <p>
            It took time to realize why Architect Satprem Maini of Auroville Earth Institute emphasized "sensibility analysis." It took time to understand why people with expertise chose something simple to teach you. When David Easton inspired me to build rammed earth, Julian Keable instilled confidence to get my hands dirty. I learned writing and teaching are more important than building for someone.
        <p>
        </p>
            I learned to write how I learned the right moisture content in different sites. And it is true that I often find in new geographical locations soil that says "you really don't have an idea, right?" But people I work with would not have an idea about why I am testing their soil for a week with multiple buckets of water. They just want their walls to show up. It is not how it works. At least, it doesn't work with me.
        <p>
            So I realized it is important to set realistic expectations before I commit to a project. I wrote a reality check. If you'd like to read this ongoing story, subscribe to Substack. We never know what awaits. Like in life.

                I offer consultations for people who want to learn rammed earth building themselves. My approach focuses on realistic expectations, soil testing, and understanding the material before rushing to build.
