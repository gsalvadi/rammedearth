        <h1>I Hear What You Need</h1>
        <div class="subtitle">Thank you for reaching out</div>

        <div class="intro">
            Thank you for your inquiry. Based on your responses, it appears you're looking for someone to build your project for you. I want to be clear about what I do and how I can help.
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What I Don't Do</h2>
            <p>I don't work as a contract builder. My focus is on teaching and knowledge transfer for people who want to learn to build with rammed earth themselves.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">If you're looking for someone to execute your project—to handle the construction, give quotes, manage timelines, and deliver a completed building—that's not the service I provide.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What I Can Do</h2>
            <p>I'll review your inquiry along with your location and project needs. If there's a professional in our directory who might be suitable for your project, I'll let you know and facilitate the connection.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">This process typically takes about a week. If I don't find a suitable match, I'll let you know that as well.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="clarity-box">
            <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
            <p>If I took on your project as a consultation but what you actually need is construction management, we'd both end up frustrated:</p>

            <ul style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: 15px;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">You'd be expecting me to solve problems that I'd be expecting you to solve</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Timeline and budget expectations wouldn't align</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">The level of hands-on involvement you're prepared for would differ from what's required</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Accountability and responsibility would be unclear</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Being clear about this now saves everyone time, money, and frustration.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What You Actually Need</h2>
            <p>For someone looking to have a rammed earth building constructed, you need contractors who:</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <ul>
                    <li>Have completed multiple rammed earth projects successfully</li>
                    <li>Can provide references and photos of past work</li>
                    <li>Understand local building codes and permit requirements</li>
                    <li>Can give you accurate quotes based on your specific project</li>
                    <li>Have their own crews, equipment, and established processes</li>
                    <li>Carry appropriate insurance and licensing</li>
                    <li>Can manage the project from design through completion</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="directory-box">
            <h3>Meanwhile: Prepare Yourself</h3>
            <p style="margin: 15px 0;">While I review your inquiry, I strongly recommend working through a reality check for what rammed earth construction actually costs and requires. This will help you evaluate any contractor you might work with.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">The guide below includes a contractor interview checklist, cost calculator, and red flags to watch for when reviewing proposals.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>How to Choose the Right Contractor</h2>
            <p>When reaching out to contractors from the directory, here are important questions to ask:</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Essential Questions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>How many rammed earth projects have you completed?</li>
                    <li>Can I visit a finished project or speak with past clients?</li>
                    <li>What's your experience with projects similar to mine in scope and budget?</li>
                    <li>How do you handle local building codes and permits?</li>
                    <li>What's your typical timeline for a project of this size?</li>
                    <li>What warranties or guarantees do you offer?</li>
                    <li>How do you handle cost overruns or unexpected issues?</li>
                    <li>What's your payment structure and schedule?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Get multiple quotes:</strong> Talk to at least 3 contractors. Compare not just price, but communication style, experience level, and how comfortable you feel with them.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Check references:</strong> Actually call past clients. Ask about timeliness, communication, quality, and whether they'd hire the contractor again.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Trust your instincts:</strong> You'll be working with this person for months. If something feels off in initial conversations, pay attention to that.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Understanding Costs</h2>
            <p>Rammed earth construction typically costs more than conventional building methods. Be prepared for:</p>

            <ul style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: 15px;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Higher material costs:</strong> Specialized formwork, equipment, and materials</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Higher labor costs:</strong> Skilled rammed earth builders command premium rates</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Longer timelines:</strong> Rammed earth takes more time than stick-frame or other methods</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Site-specific factors:</strong> Soil conditions, access, climate all affect cost</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Good contractors will be honest about these realities. If someone quotes significantly lower than others, ask why—it might indicate inexperience or hidden costs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" style="background: #FFF9C4; padding: 25px; border-radius: 8px; border: 2px solid #F57C00; margin: 30px 0;">
            <h2 style="color: #E65100; margin-top: 0;">Before You Hire: Evaluate Contractors Systematically</h2>
            <p>I've created a practical resource specifically for people hiring rammed earth contractors—helping you ask the right questions, understand real costs, and avoid expensive mistakes when evaluating bids.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">This isn't generic advice. It's a structured framework developed from seeing what goes wrong when clients don't know what to ask or how to compare contractors properly. The contractor interview checklist alone can save you from costly mismatches.</p>

            <div style="background: white; padding: 20px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 20px 0;">
                <h4 style="color: #8B4513; margin-bottom: 10px;">What's included:</h4>
                <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Contractor interview checklist with specific questions to ask about experience, process, and guarantees</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Cost calculator template to evaluate quotes and identify hidden expenses</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Red flags to watch for when reviewing proposals</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Comparison framework to evaluate multiple contractors objectively</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;">
                <a href="https://oddnote.gumroad.com/l/nqtvry" target="_blank" style="display: inline-block; background: #F57C00; color: white; padding: 15px 30px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px; font-weight: bold; transition: all 0.3s;">Get the Guide (Gumroad)</a>

            </div>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px; font-style: italic; color: #666; text-align: center;">Use this before meeting with contractors. It will help you ask informed questions and spot the difference between experienced professionals and those learning on your project.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Alternative: Hybrid Approach</h2>
            <p>Some contractors offer a middle path where they handle the technical aspects while you provide some labor. This can reduce costs while ensuring quality. Ask contractors if they offer:</p>

            <ul style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: 15px;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Owner-builder partnership models</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Training + supervision packages</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Phased work where they handle critical stages</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">This isn't right for everyone, but it might give you more hands-on involvement without the full responsibility of being an owner-builder.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>If You Change Your Mind</h2>
            <p>If after talking with contractors you realize you'd actually like to learn to build yourself—that you want the knowledge, not just the building—then consultation might make sense.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">At that point, come back and fill out the consultation form again, this time with that shift in perspective. We can explore whether you're ready for that path.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">But for now, based on what you've shared, working with an experienced contractor is your best path forward.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Good Luck With Your Project</h2>
            <p>Building with rammed earth—whether you do it yourself or hire it done—is a meaningful choice. The contractors in the directory are skilled professionals who can help you realize your vision.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Take your time choosing the right one. Ask questions. Visit completed projects if you can. And don't hesitate to reach out to multiple contractors to find the best fit.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">I hope you end up with a beautiful, enduring building that serves you well for decades to come.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #8B4513; margin-top: 0;">About This Assessment</h3>
            <p>Your responses were analyzed by an algorithm that looks for indicators of experience, motivation, self-awareness, and reflective thinking. It's designed to help me understand where you are in your journey with earth building.</p>

            <p><strong>But here's what matters more:</strong> I read every submission personally. The algorithm is a tool, not a verdict. If you feel it misunderstood your situation, or if you want to clarify anything from your responses, please email me directly.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes the most important information doesn't fit neatly into text boxes. I'm interested in your actual situation, not just what an algorithm can measure.</p>
