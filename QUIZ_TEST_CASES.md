**Purpose**: Test all 7 consultation quiz outcomes with realistic responses
**Date Created**: November 5, 2025
**Test URL**: Add `?debug=true` to see scoring breakdown

---

## Test Case 1: CONSCIOUS (60-100%)

**Expected Score**: 12-20 points (60-100%)
**Expected Landing Page**: `consultation-conscious.html`
**Expected Action**: Direct consultation within 1 week

### Test Responses

**Q1: What have you already tried to build?**
```
I've built a 30-foot garden wall using clay-rich soil from my property. The first section cracked badly because I didn't compact enough in layers. I learned to test moisture content by hand and adjust my mix ratio to about 70% sand, 30% clay. It took me 6 months of weekends, and I documented every failure. The wall is still standing after two winters, though I can see where my technique improved section by section.
```

**Scoring Prediction**:
- Length >80, no "nothing" → +1.5
- Specifics (30-foot, 70%, 30%, 6 months, two winters) → +1.5
- Materials (clay, soil, sand, moisture, mix, ratio) = 6 mentions → +1.5
- Failure (cracked, didn't compact) → +1
- **Experience: 5/5**

---

**Q2: Why do you want to build with rammed earth?**
```
I want to understand the relationship between compression and time. There's something about working with earth that demands presence—you can't rush it. I'm drawn to the craft of reading soil and knowing when the material is ready. It feels like a practice, not just a technique. I've learned more about patience from watching earth dry than from any meditation retreat.
```

**Scoring Prediction**:
- Deep words (understand, relationship, craft, practice, presence) = 5 → +2.5
- Journey language (drawn to, feels like, demands) → +1.5
- Sentences = 5, vocabulary richness ≈ 0.70 → +1
- **Motivation: 5/5**

---

**Q3: What's your primary hurdle?**
```
My own patience. I want to move faster than the material allows. I struggle with not knowing if I'm doing it right until weeks later when it's dried. The uncertainty challenges my need for control. I'm learning to trust the process and read the subtle signs—how the earth feels, sounds when tamped, responds to pressure. Building my confidence to listen rather than force.
```

**Scoring Prediction**:
- Internal (patience, not knowing, confidence, trust, learning) = 5 → +2.5
- Specifics (weeks later, subtle signs) → yes
- Sentences = 5 → +1
- **Self-Awareness: 3.5/4**

---

**Q4: What did the earth teach you when it failed?**
```
When my wall cracked, I realized I was treating earth like concrete—trying to control it rather than listen to what it needed. The cracks showed me I was rushing. Now I understand that failure is the material teaching me to pay attention to moisture, to compression, to rhythm. The earth doesn't lie—it shows you exactly where you weren't present. That humbled me.
```

**Scoring Prediction**:
- Reflective words (realized, listen, understand, teaching, humbled) = 5, sentences = 4 → +4
- Specifics (moisture, compression, rhythm) → +1
- **Reflection: 5/6**

**TOTAL PREDICTED: 18.5/20 = 92.5% → CONSCIOUS ✓**

## Test Case 2: DEVELOPING (40-59%)

**Expected Score**: 8-11.9 points (40-59%)
**Expected Landing Page**: `consultation-developing.html`
**Expected Action**: Four essential practices, return later

### Test Responses

**Q1: What have you already tried to build?**
```
I built a small test wall last summer, about 3 feet tall and 6 feet long. Used local soil that I think had too much clay because it cracked quite a bit. I mixed it pretty dry and tamped it with a 2x4. It held up through the winter okay despite the cracks. I also made a bunch of test bricks with different ratios but didn't document which was which, so that was a mistake.
```

**Scoring Prediction**:
- Length >80, no "nothing" → +1.5
- Specifics (3 feet, 6 feet, last summer, 2x4) → +1.5
- Materials (soil, clay, mixed, dry) = 4 → +1.5
- Failure (cracked, mistake) → +1
- **Experience: 5/5**

---

**Q2: Why do you want to build with rammed earth?**
```
I want to build naturally and learn a skill that feels meaningful. Rammed earth seems like a good sustainable option that uses local materials. I like the idea of creating something solid and lasting from dirt. It's also interesting from an environmental perspective.
```

**Scoring Prediction**:
- Deep words (meaningful) = 1 → +1.5
- Surface words (naturally, sustainable, environmental) = 3 → (overridden by deep)
- Journey language (like the idea of) → +1.5
- Sentences = 4, vocabulary ≈ 0.60 → +0
- **Motivation: 3/5**

---

**Q3: What's your primary hurdle?**
```
Finding reliable information about the right techniques. There's a lot of conflicting advice online about soil ratios and moisture content. I'm also not sure how to test if what I'm doing will actually be structurally sound. Time is somewhat limited too since I work full-time.
```

**Scoring Prediction**:
- Internal (not sure) = 1 → +1.5
- External (time) = 1, length >60 → +0.5
- Sentences = 3 → +1
- **Self-Awareness: 3/4**

---

**Q4: What did the earth teach you when it failed?**
```
The cracks taught me that I probably used too much clay in my mix and maybe didn't compact it evenly. I need to learn more about getting the ratios right.
```

**Scoring Prediction**:
- Reflective words (taught, learn) = 2, sentences = 2 → +2.5
- Specifics (clay, ratios, evenly) → +1
- **Reflection: 3.5/6**

**TOTAL PREDICTED: 14.5/20 = 72.5% → CONSCIOUS** (Oops, too high!)

Let me adjust Q2 and Q4:

**Q2 (Revised):**
```
I want to build with natural materials and rammed earth seems sustainable and interesting.
```

**Scoring Prediction**:
- Surface words (natural, sustainable) = 2 → +0.5
- **Motivation: 0.5/5**

**Q4 (Revised):**
```
It showed me I need to learn more about soil composition and proper moisture levels.
```

**Scoring Prediction**:
- Reflective words (learn) = 1 → +1.5
- Length <40 chars, not eligible → 0 bonus
- **Reflection: 1.5/6**

**TOTAL PREDICTED: 10.5/20 = 52.5% → DEVELOPING ✓**

## Test Case 3: BEGINNER (25-39%)

**Expected Score**: 5-7.9 points (25-39%)
**Expected Landing Page**: `consultation-beginner.html`
**Expected Action**: Four foundational steps

### Test Responses

**Q1: What have you already tried to build?**
```
Nothing yet with rammed earth, but I've done some gardening and pottery. I'm drawn to earth building because it seems like a natural extension of working with clay. I haven't had the time or space to try building yet, but I've been researching it for about a year.
```

**Scoring Prediction**:
- Contains "nothing yet" → +0
- Specifics (year, pottery) → +1.5
- Materials (earth, clay) = 2 → +1.5
- No failure → +0
- **Experience: 3/5**

---

**Q2: Why do you want to build with rammed earth?**
```
It's a sustainable building method that uses natural materials and has a low environmental impact. I like the aesthetic and the idea of building something myself. It seems more connected to the earth than conventional construction.
```

**Scoring Prediction**:
- Surface words (sustainable, natural, environmental, earth) = 4 → +0.5
- Journey language (connected to) → +1.5
- Sentences = 3, vocabulary ≈ 0.58 → +0
- **Motivation: 2/5**

---

**Q3: What's your primary hurdle?**
```
I don't have the knowledge or experience yet. I'm not sure where to start or what tools I'd need. Budget is also a consideration since I don't want to invest a lot before knowing if this is something I can actually do.
```

**Scoring Prediction**:
- Internal (don't have knowledge/experience, not sure) = 2 → +2.5
- External (budget, tools) = 2, but length >60 → +0.5

## Test Case 6: COST-FOCUSED (Red Flag)

**Expected Score**: N/A (immediate redirect)
**Expected Landing Page**: `consultation-cost-focused.html`
**Expected Action**: Contractor directory

### Test Responses

**Q1: What have you already tried to build?**
```
Nothing yet, but I've been looking into different building methods.
```

---

**Q2: Why do you want to build with rammed earth?**
```
I need to build on a tight budget and I've heard rammed earth can be a cheaper option than conventional construction. I want to save money on materials and labor if possible.
```

**Trigger Detection**:
- Contains "tight budget" → cost phrase ✓
- Contains "cheaper" → cost keyword ✓
- Contains "save money" → cost phrase ✓
- Learning context: "if possible" doesn't trigger exception
- Length = 140 chars but no learning keywords

**REDIRECT: COST-FOCUSED ✓**

---

**Alternative Test (with learning context that should PASS):**
```
I'm on a budget but I really want to learn the craft of earth building and understand the material deeply. While cost is a factor, I'm more interested in developing the skill and knowledge over time. I'm willing to invest the time to learn properly even if it means saving money isn't the primary benefit.
```

**Trigger Detection**:
- Contains "budget" → cost keyword
- But also contains: learn, craft, understand, knowledge, skill (learning context)
- Length >100
- Should bypass cost-focused flag ✓

2. **False negatives**: Genuine candidates classified too low
3. **Borderline accuracy**: Are 35-45% flags actually borderline cases?
4. **Generic detection**: Are template responses being caught?
5. **Conversion rates**: Which levels actually book consultations?

Use this data to adjust:
- Keyword lists (add/remove words)
- Point weights (increase/decrease category values)
- Threshold percentages (shift boundaries)
- Negation detection (expand context window)
