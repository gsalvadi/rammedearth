        <h1>A Good Place to Start</h1>
        <div class="subtitle">Thank you for your honest responses</div>

        <div class="intro">
            You're at the beginning of something that could become deeply meaningful. Earth building asks for embodied knowledge that develops through direct experience—there's no shortcut to this learning. But there's also no rush. The material will wait for you.
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Where You Are</h2>
            <p>Based on your responses, you're in the early exploration phase. You have curiosity about rammed earth, but haven't yet had much direct, hands-on experience with earth as a building material. This is completely fine—everyone starts here.</p>

            <p>The question is: are you ready to move from curiosity to practice? Not theory. Not videos. Not research. Practice.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Important:</strong> Don't start by trying to build something permanent. Don't invest in expensive equipment or materials yet. First, you need to understand if this work actually calls to you—and that can only happen through simple, direct experience with the material itself.
        </div>

        <div class="section" style="background: #FFF9C4; padding: 25px; border-radius: 8px; border: 2px solid #F57C00; margin: 30px 0;">
            <h2 style="color: #E65100; margin-top: 0;">Before You Start: Understand the Commitment</h2>
            <p>I've created a practical guide for people at your stage—those ready to start but unsure of what they're getting into. It helps you assess the real time, cost, and effort required before you invest too much.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">This resource walks through what's actually involved in earth building—not the romanticized version, but the real work. Many beginners overestimate their readiness or underestimate the commitment. This guide helps you understand both honestly.</p>

            <div style="background: white; padding: 20px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 20px 0;">
                <h4 style="color: #8B4513; margin-bottom: 10px;">What's included:</h4>
                <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Your Foundation: Four Essential Steps</h2>
            <p>These aren't preparation for earth building—they ARE earth building. Do them in order. Take your time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step-box">
            <h3><span class="step-number">1</span> Test Your Local Soil</h3>
            <p>Before anything else, you need to understand the soil where you are.</p>

            <div class="resource-box">
                <h4>What to do:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Collect soil samples from different spots around your property or building site</li>
                    <li>Do a simple jar test: fill a clear jar 1/3 with soil, add water to top, shake vigorously, let settle for 24 hours</li>
                    <li>You'll see layers: gravel/sand on bottom, silt in middle, clay on top</li>
                    <li>Learn about clay content, organic matter, and what makes soil suitable for building</li>
                    <li>Contact your local soil conservation district—they often provide free testing and advice</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Until you understand your local soil, everything else is abstract. This makes it real and specific to your place.</p>

            <p><strong>Time needed:</strong> 2-3 hours for collection and testing, plus 24-48 hours waiting time</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step-box">
            <h3><span class="step-number">2</span> Make 20 Test Bricks and Let Each One Fail</h3>
            <p>This is where most people want to rush. Don't. This step teaches you more than anything else you can do.</p>

            <div class="resource-box">
                <h4>What to do:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make simple brick-sized test blocks (6" x 3" x 3" roughly)</li>
                    <li>Use different soil mixes: more clay, more sand, different moisture levels</li>
                    <li>Try different compaction methods: hand-packed, tamped hard, barely compressed</li>
                    <li>Label each one (date, mix ratio, method)</li>
                    <li>Let them dry naturally - watch what cracks, what stays solid, what surprises you</li>
                    <li>After they're fully dry (1-2 weeks), test their strength - break them, drop them, soak them</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Failure is information. Each crack teaches you something about water content, clay percentage, or compaction. This knowledge will save you from expensive mistakes later.</p>

            <p><strong>Time needed:</strong> 5-8 hours spread over 2-3 weeks</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step-box">
            <h3><span class="step-number">3</span> Read "Earth Construction Handbook" by Gernot Minke</h3>
            <p>Now—after you've gotten your hands dirty—read about the principles.</p>

            <div class="resource-box">
                <h4>Why this book and why now:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>It covers principles, not just techniques</li>
                    <li>You'll actually understand what you're reading because you've touched the material</li>
                    <li>It addresses different earth building methods so you can see where rammed earth fits</li>
                    <li>Reading it after hands-on work makes theory become practical knowledge</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Books before practice give you information. Books after practice give you understanding.</p>

            <p><strong>Time needed:</strong> 6-10 hours of reading, plus however long you spend thinking about it</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step-box">
            <h3><span class="step-number">4</span> Spend Time With Earth Before Trying to Build With It</h3>
            <p>This sounds abstract, but it's the most important step.</p>

            <div class="resource-box">
                <h4>What to do:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mix earth with different amounts of water—just to feel how it changes</li>
                    <li>Hold dry clay in your hands, then slowly add water, sensing each stage</li>
                    <li>Form shapes without trying to "build" anything—just explore what the material can do</li>
                    <li>Notice how it responds to pressure, to drying, to moisture</li>
                    <li>Do this for 20-30 minutes several times, with no goal except observation</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> You're developing tactile intelligence. Your hands will learn to read moisture content, compression needs, and structural potential before your mind can articulate it. This embodied knowledge is what separates competent builders from people following instructions.</p>

            <p><strong>Time needed:</strong> 20-30 minutes, repeated 5-10 times over several weeks</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            "Earth building is not complicated. But it is deep. These steps might seem simple—and they are. That doesn't mean they're easy or quick. Give yourself permission to be a beginner. Give the material permission to teach you."

            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">When you've completed them—and I mean really completed them, not just checked them off—you'll be in a much stronger position to:</p>

                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Know if earth building actually resonates with you</li>
