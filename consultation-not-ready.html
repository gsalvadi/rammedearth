        <h1>Perhaps Take More Time</h1>
        <div class="subtitle">Thank you for reaching out</div>

        <div class="intro">
            Based on your responses, I sense you may still be in the very early stages of exploring this interest. That's not a problem—but it does mean consultation isn't the right step yet.
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What I'm Noticing</h2>
            <p>When someone is ready for consultation or serious learning about rammed earth, there's usually a quality of engagement that comes through in their responses—a sense that they've wrestled with the material, or at least wrestled with why they're drawn to it.</p>

            <p>Your responses suggest you're still in the exploration phase. You're curious, which is valuable. But curiosity alone isn't enough foundation for the kind of committed work that earth building requires.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Questions to Ask Yourself</h2>
            <p>Before pursuing consultation, workshops, or even self-directed learning, spend some time with these questions. Write down your answers. Be honest.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reflection-box">
            <h3>Reflective Questions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Why earth building and not something else?</strong> What specifically draws you to this material, this method, this practice? Is it aesthetics? Philosophy? Practicality? A feeling you can't quite name?</li>

                <li><strong>What does building mean to you?</strong> Not "building a house" in abstract, but the actual act of building. Working with your hands, physical labor, problem-solving in real time with real materials.</li>

                <li><strong>What are you avoiding by staying theoretical?</strong> Sometimes we stay in the research phase because actually doing the work is scary, messy, or reveals things we're not ready to face. What might you be protecting yourself from?</li>

                <li><strong>Is this more than passing curiosity?</strong> Be brutally honest. Are you genuinely called to work with earth, or is this an interesting idea that will fade when the next interesting idea comes along?</li>

                <li><strong>What would it take for you to actually start?</strong> Not start "planning to start" or "preparing to start," but actually get your hands dirty with earth this week. If you can't answer this concretely, that's information.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Difference Between Interest and Calling</h2>
            <p>I'm interested in many things: woodworking, pottery, gardening, dozens of crafts and practices. I'm called to very few things. Earth building is one of them.</p>

            <p>Interest is light. It comes and goes. It's enjoyable to think about. Calling is heavier. It persists. It nags at you. It demands something of you.</p>

            <p>You don't need calling to start exploring. But you do need it to sustain the work when it gets hard—and it will get hard.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Right now, I don't know if earth building is calling you or just interesting to you. Neither do you, probably. That's okay. But it's worth finding out before investing serious time or money.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            "Spend time understanding whether earth building truly calls to you. When you're ready to engage more deeply, the door is open. But don't rush. Clarity comes first."
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Gentle Suggestions</h2>
            <p>If you're still exploring whether this work resonates with you, here are some low-commitment ways to find out:</p>

            <div class="resource-box">
                <ul>
                    <li>Read personal accounts of earth building (not technical manuals, but stories)</li>
                    <li>Visit existing rammed earth or natural buildings in person if you can</li>
                    <li>Attend a one-day workshop or site tour (observation, not full commitment)</li>
                    <li>Spend time in nature noticing earth, soil, geology—develop curiosity about the material itself</li>
                    <li>Journal about why this interests you and see if the why deepens or fades</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What You Might Read</h2>

            <div class="resource-box">
                <h4>Books That Explore the "Why" More Than the "How"</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>"The Hand-Sculpted House" by Ianto Evans - Philosophy and practice intertwined</li>
                    <li>"A Pattern Language" by Christopher Alexander - Understanding how we relate to buildings</li>
                    <li>"The Timeless Way of Building" by Christopher Alexander - On the deeper nature of construction</li>
                    <li><a href="https://rammedearth.substack.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #8B4513;">The Rammed Earth Chronicles</a> - Personal reflections on the practice</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What Not to Do</h2>
            <p>Please don't:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: 15px;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Invest in expensive workshops or courses yet</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Buy equipment or materials "just in case"</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Start planning your dream project in detail</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Research to the point where research becomes a substitute for action</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Force yourself to be more interested than you actually are</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">All of these are forms of rushing. And rushing past uncertainty doesn't resolve it—it just buries it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Permission to Not Know</h2>
            <p>You don't have to know right now if earth building is for you. You don't have to commit. You don't have to prove your seriousness to anyone, including yourself.</p>

            <p>What you do need is honesty about where you actually are. And right now, you're in the wondering phase. That's legitimate. Honor it.</p>

            <p>Spend some time there. Let the wondering deepen into something clearer—either a yes that pulls you forward or a no that lets you move on to what does call you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            "Not everyone is meant to build with earth. Not everyone is meant to build at all. There's no shame in discovering this isn't your path. But there is waste in pretending you know before you actually do."
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>If and When You're Ready</h2>
            <p>If after this reflection time you find yourself still pulled toward earth building—if the interest becomes calling, if wondering becomes knowing—reach out again.</p>

            <p>At that point, you'll have:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 25px; margin-top: 15px;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Clarity about why you're pursuing this</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Some initial experience to build on</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Specific questions rather than general curiosity</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Readiness to commit to the learning process</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Until then, be patient with yourself. The work will be here when you're ready for it.</p>
